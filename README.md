Thoughts throughout project.
Started by following the demo and coding along. Had a clear idea of what I wanted to achieve, which is a photo gallery of my dog. Began by going in and finding the images I wanted to include. Began by saving the images to my computer, creating a folder within my V.S.Code and dragging the images into the folder. V.S code doesnt like the code so I asked a fellow student for advice about how img src are laid out in V.S code and he pointed out that images pulled from personal folders can slow down github which might make the loading of my website slower. He recommended pulling the URLS directly from the social media site I got the photos from.
