Thoughts throughout project.
Started by following the demo and coding along. Had a clear idea of what I wanted to achieve, which is a photo gallery of my dog. Began by going in and finding the images I wanted to include. Began by saving the images to my computer, creating a folder within my V.S.Code and dragging the images into the folder. V.S code doesnt like the code so I asked a fellow student for advice about how img src are laid out in V.S code and he pointed out that images pulled from personal folders can slow down github which might make the loading of my website slower. He recommended pulling the URLS directly from the social media site I got the photos from.
Went back in and changed the img src to URLs pulled from facebook pictures, however the code underlined red so asked Joe about the urls; whether the structure of the urls was different if the imaages were pulled from facebook. Joe recommended using local host, as images from public media sites like facebook might block the images - he then recommended I check on 'go live' if the image would load. The image didnt load so I went back in and changed the facebook URLS to relative file paths. Joe also advised that because I'm only using a small amount of images, it should affect how they load through github, and that later on in the course we would be learning about how to deal with git hub around more images.
Went through all the demonstrations trying to work out how to do the loop for the array of images. Fried my brain, asked lots of questions of peers and teachers - ended up writing code for each image instead of using the i value to call the information from the array. It's abit disorientating not being able to see the images on the page yet.
Came back to the project after a day inbetween doing a different assignement, and looking at the code for this assignement blanked my brain. Immediately felt stressed because I couldn't make sense of my thoughts for how I was supposed to do the second part for making the large images. Went through the class demos and workshops for arrays, functions, loops, got overwhelmed and went out for a walk with the dog while rubber ducking through the porblem with my husband. Still felt stuck when i came back so asked chat GPT to NOT give me the answer or any code but to point me in the right direction. Still felt like the steps weren't clicking in my head so went in discord and asked for a classmate to rubber duck with - talked through it all with joe from class and then worked through repeating the steps for retrieving the images to creat the large images. Got lots of error messages with the code so kept working through them, making little changes trying to work out what was needed - another class mate, Sam, helped by spotting some typos. Eventually got the result of having the images appear on the webpage really big so moved on to formatting them in css.
Joe recommended leaving the images off and using background colours on the containers to format the page so I didn't get overwhelmed with formatting the images, until I'd set the layout.
