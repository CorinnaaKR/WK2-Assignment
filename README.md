Thoughts throughout project.
Started by following the demo and coding along. Had a clear idea of what I wanted to achieve, which is a photo gallery of my dog. Began by going in and finding the images I wanted to include. Began by saving the images to my computer, creating a folder within my V.S.Code and dragging the images into the folder. V.S code doesnt like the code so I asked a fellow student for advice about how img src are laid out in V.S code and he pointed out that images pulled from personal folders can slow down github which might make the loading of my website slower. He recommended pulling the URLS directly from the social media site I got the photos from.
Went back in and changed the img src to URLs pulled from facebook pictures, however the code underlined red so asked Joe about the urls; whether the structure of the urls was different if the imaages were pulled from facebook. Joe recommended using local host, as images from public media sites like facebook might block the images - he then recommended I check on 'go live' if the image would load. The image didnt load so I went back in and changed the facebook URLS to relative file paths. Joe also advised that because I'm only using a small amount of images, it should affect how they load through github, and that later on in the course we would be learning about how to deal with git hub around more images.
Went through all the demonstrations trying to work out how to do the loop for the array of images. Fried my brain, asked lots of questions of peers and teachers - ended up writing code for each image instead of using the i value to call the information from the array. It's abit disorientating not being able to see the images on the page yet.
